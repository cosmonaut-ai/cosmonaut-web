# Audio Narration (TTS) - Implementation Guide

## Overview

Story nodes can have AI-generated audio narrations via ElevenLabs TTS. Customers choose from a **pre-defined list of voices**. The backend generates MP3 audio on demand, stores it on S3/CDN (one file per node/voice combination), and returns a permanent URL. Audio generation is **usage-capped** per subscription tier, with a special lifetime-cap rule for free users.

---

## Backend Summary

- **Model**: ElevenLabs Flash 2.5 (`eleven_flash_v2_5`) - generates in ~1-3 seconds.
- **Voices**: 7 pre-defined voices, each with an internal `id`, a `display_name`, and a private ElevenLabs voice ID. Only `id` and `display_name` are exposed through the API.
- **Storage**: MP3 files stored in S3 at `audio/{world_id}/{node_id}/{voice_id}.mp3`, served via CloudFront CDN. URLs are permanent and publicly accessible.
- **Multi-voice per node**: Each node can have audio generated for multiple voices. Each voice/node combination is stored and served independently.
- **Idempotency**: If audio already exists for a given node + voice, the endpoint returns the cached URL instantly without consuming quota.
- **Race protection**: Concurrent requests for the same node + voice are safe - only the first generation consumes quota.

### Available Voices

| Internal ID | Display Name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `riley`     | Riley        |
| `katherine` | Katherine    |
| `paige`     | Paige        |
| `peter`     | Peter        |
| `theo`      | Theo         |
| `michael`   | Michael      |
| `jon`       | Jon          |

### Tier Limits

| Tier      | Audio narrations | Period  | Reset behaviour                 |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| FREE      | 10               | N/A     | **Never resets** (lifetime cap) |
| EXPLORER  | 10               | N/A     | **Never resets** (lifetime cap, shared with Free) |
| COSMONAUT | 150              | 30 days | Resets each billing period      |

> Free and Explorer tiers share a lifetime audio pool of 10 narrations — once used, the user must upgrade to Cosmonaut for monthly audio. The audio counter persists across FREE ↔ EXPLORER tier changes. Only Cosmonaut gets fresh audio quota each billing cycle.

## API Reference

### List Available Voices

```
GET /voices/
```

**Auth**: None required (public endpoint).

**Success response** (`200 OK`):

```json
[
	{
		"id": "riley",
		"display_name": "Riley",
		"description": "A warm, midrange voice with a natural conversational tone.",
		"sample_url": "https://images.dev.cosmonaut-ai.com/voices/riley/sample.mp3"
	},
	{
		"id": "katherine",
		"display_name": "Katherine",
		"description": "A smooth, British-accented voice with refined elegance.",
		"sample_url": "https://images.dev.cosmonaut-ai.com/voices/katherine/sample.mp3"
	}
]
```

Each voice includes:

- `id` -- internal identifier used in API requests.
- `display_name` -- human-readable name for UI display.
- `description` -- short blurb describing the voice character.
- `sample_url` -- CDN URL to a sample MP3 so users can preview the voice before generating.

> **Note**: Sample MP3 files must be uploaded to S3 at `voices/{voice_id}/sample.mp3` for each voice.

### Generate Audio for a Node

```
POST /worlds/{world_id}/nodes/{node_id}/audio
```

**Auth**: Requires a valid JWT (same as all `/worlds` endpoints).

**Preconditions**:

- The node must exist.
- The node's `generation_status` must be `"completed"` (i.e., text has been fully generated). If text is still streaming or hasn't been generated, the endpoint returns `400`.

**Request body**:

```json
{
	"voice_id": "riley"
}
```

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `voice_id` | string | Yes      | Internal voice ID from the `/voices/` endpoint. |

**Success response** (`200 OK`):

```json
{
	"audio_url": "https://images.dev.cosmonaut-ai.com/audio/{world_id}/{node_id}/riley.mp3"
}
```

The `audio_url` is a permanent CDN link to the MP3 file. It can be used directly in an HTML `<audio>` element.

**Error responses**:

| Status | Condition                          | Response `detail`                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Unknown voice_id                   | `"Unknown voice_id: {voice_id}"`                   |
| `400`  | Node text not yet generated        | `"Node {node_id} text has not been generated yet"` |
| `403`  | User not authorized for this world | `"You are not authorized to access world ..."`     |
| `404`  | World or node not found            | `"World {id} not found"` / `"Node {id} not found"` |
| `429`  | Audio quota exceeded               | `"Quota exceeded: audio limit is {limit}"`         |
| `500`  | ElevenLabs or S3 failure           | `"Audio generation failed"`                        |

> The `429` response is the key one for triggering the upgrade prompt on the frontend.

### Get Usage Info

```
GET /auth/usage
```

The existing usage endpoint includes audio fields:

```json
{
	"tier": "EXPLORER",
	"nodes_used": 42,
	"nodes_limit": 200,
	"worlds_created": 3,
	"worlds_limit": 20,
	"worlds_stored": 3,
	"worlds_stored_limit": 50,
	"audio_narrations_used": 7,
	"audio_narrations_limit": 10,
	"period_end": "2026-03-08T00:00:00+00:00",
	"pending_cancellation": false,
	"cancellation_date": null,
	"subscription_status": "active",
	"pending_tier": null,
	"pending_tier_date": null
}
```

- `audio_narrations_used` - how many audio narrations the user has generated (lifetime for Free/Explorer, per-period for Cosmonaut).
- `audio_narrations_limit` - the user's tier cap (10 lifetime for Free/Explorer, 150/month for Cosmonaut).

---

### Story Node DTO

All endpoints that return a `StoryNodeDTO` now include an `audio` dictionary mapping voice IDs to CDN URLs:

```json
{
	"id": "0a",
	"world_id": "abc123",
	"text": "The ancient door creaked open...",
	"title": "The Threshold",
	"generation_status": "completed",
	"audio": {
		"riley": "https://images.dev.cosmonaut-ai.com/audio/abc123/0a/riley.mp3",
		"theo": "https://images.dev.cosmonaut-ai.com/audio/abc123/0a/theo.mp3"
	},
	"...": "..."
}
```

- `audio` - `object`. A dictionary of `{voice_id: audio_url}`. Empty object `{}` if no audio has been generated for this node.

---

## Frontend Implementation Guide

### 1. API Client

The current frontend API helpers live in `src/lib/api/voices.ts`:

```typescript
import { listVoices, generateNodeAudio } from '$lib/api/voices';

const voices = await listVoices();
const { audio_url, timestamps_url } = await generateNodeAudio(worldId, nodeId, voiceId);
```

These helpers use the shared `apiRequest` wrapper for auth headers and normalized API errors.

### 2. Voice Selection UI

- Fetch available voices from `GET /voices/` (can be cached - the list is static).
- Present a voice picker (e.g., dropdown, radio buttons, or voice cards) before or alongside the audio play button.
- Store the user's selected voice preference in local storage for convenience.

### 3. Node View Integration

In the narration component used by the story node view:

**State**:

- `selectedVoiceId: string` - the user's chosen voice.
- `isGeneratingAudio: boolean` - true while the POST request is in flight.
- Use the node's `audio` dict from the DTO to determine if audio already exists for the selected voice.

**UI**:

- Add a narration button (e.g., speaker/Volume2 icon) near the existing controls.
- **Disable** the button when:
  - Text is still streaming (`isStreaming` or `isNodeGenerating`)
  - `generation_status !== "completed"`
  - `isGeneratingAudio` is true (show a spinner/loading state instead)

**Behaviour**:

```
if node.audio[selectedVoiceId] exists:
    → Play/pause toggle using <audio> element
else:
    → Call generateNodeAudio(worldId, nodeId, selectedVoiceId)
    → On success: update node.audio[selectedVoiceId] in local state, begin playback
    → On 429 error: show UpgradePrompt (reuse existing quota-exceeded pattern)
    → On other error: show toast/error message
```

**Playback**:

- Use a standard HTML `<audio>` element or a Svelte audio binding.
- The CDN URL can be set as the `src` directly - no auth headers needed for playback.
- Consider preloading: `<audio preload="none">` to avoid unnecessary bandwidth on page load.

### 4. Usage Display

Display audio usage alongside existing usage meters:

```
Audio narrations: 12 / 30
```

### 5. Clean Up

Do not reintroduce browser-native `window.speechSynthesis` as the primary narration path. The production narration UI should use the generated audio API and CDN-hosted MP3 files.

## Sequence Diagram

```
User clicks "Play Audio" on a completed story node (with voice selected)
  │
  ├─ node.audio[selectedVoiceId] exists?
  │   ├─ YES → Play the MP3 directly (no API call)
  │   └─ NO  → POST /worlds/{worldId}/nodes/{nodeId}/audio
  │              Body: { "voice_id": "riley" }
  │              │
  │              ├─ 200 → { audio_url: "https://cdn.../audio/.../riley.mp3" }
  │              │         Update local node state, begin playback
  │              │
  │              ├─ 400 → Unknown voice or node text not ready
  │              │
  │              ├─ 429 → Quota exceeded → Show UpgradePrompt
  │              │
  │              └─ 500 → Generation failed → Show error toast
```

## Notes

- Audio generation takes ~1-3 seconds. The UI should show a loading/spinner state during this time.
- The returned `audio_url` is permanent - once generated, it never expires or changes. The frontend can cache it freely.
- The endpoint is idempotent per voice: calling it multiple times for the same node + voice always returns the same URL and only consumes quota once.
- Audio files are MP3 format, typically 100-300KB for a story node.
- Each voice generation counts as one audio narration toward the user's quota, even on the same node.
